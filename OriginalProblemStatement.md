#State Farm 2020 Java Coding Competition 

The Problem
Welcome to the 2020 State Farm Java Coding Competition. For this year’s challenge, you will be provided with a skeleton Java project with ten JUnit Tests and the stubs of their corresponding methods, as well as four sets of data:
1.	Agents.csv – Representational data of insurance agents.
2.	Claims.csv – Representational data of insurance claims.
3.	Customers.csv – Representational data of customers either with existing insurance policies, or seeking to start an insurance policy.
4.	Vendors.csv – Representational data of area vendors that can complete work related to a filed insurance claim.

Your task is to complete the Java method stubs such that they pass the given JUnit tests, using the four sets of data provided. Please read the description of each method stub carefully before attempting to complete it.

Bonus “Nice to have” features
Once you’ve completed the above Java functions, consider implementing your version of the following extra features:

•	Create a GUI to interact with functions and display results graphically or in another creative way of your choosing.
•	Consider additional important or interesting data correlations, and demonstrate these correlations either functionally, visually or both.
•	Have a better idea for bonus features than we’ve indicated here? Go for it!

                               ********* Do not change anything in the JUnit tests! **********
First Actions:
•	Import the problem statement into your IDE.
•	We have provided Maven dependency for JUnit 4.  If you are not set up with the recommended IDE (Spring Tool Suite), you may need to add JUnit 4.
•	If you identify any additional libraries you would like to use, please add them to the pom.xml file or copy the .jar files into the resources folder
•	Run your JUnit tests, code, and repeat.

When you are done:
•	Update the feedback.txt file and include the following information:
o	Your team – name of each individual participating.
o	How many JUnits you were able to execute successfully.
o	Document and describe the additional “nice to have” features included, to help the judges properly grade your submission and explain how to properly execute new enhancements.

•	Push your changes to one single branch for you and your teammate.  Open a single pull request against the main State Farm Coding Competition repository before 11:59PM CST on October 10, 2020.
o	If you make any commits after midnight without prior approval from codingcompetition@statefarm.com, your submission will be disqualified.
o	If you so choose, you may open a pull request at any time during the competition and continue to update it as long as you do not make any commits after midnight.

Rules

•	Contestants cannot seek help from individuals outside their team.
•	Teams are expected to have the necessary tools and JARs preloaded on their machines prior to the competition.
•	If you believe this document and the JUnit tests conflict, the JUnit tests are the highest authority.

How you will be Graded

•	100% core requirements met, including:
o	Number of JUnits that pass using correct functionality in the program
o	Maintaining Object Oriented Programming principles
o	Code documentation
o	Code must compile and execute
•	Do not complete any Bonus unless you have all the JUnit tests completed
o	Bonus credit awarded for any extra features added (up to 10%)

In the event of a tie, we will further judge your solution based on: code cleanliness, maintainability, and adherence to object-orientated principles.
